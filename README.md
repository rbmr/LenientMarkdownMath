Obsidian is very lenient when parsing unusual block formulas. 

For example:
```markdown
- This is a block formula, placed inline $$\text{A Formula}$$
```

Renders as:
- This is a block formula, placed inline $$\text{A Formula}$$

Other markdown renderers (such as those used by Quartz) could fail, or place the formula inline, but obsidian still renders it as a proper block formula. 

In order to prevent ambiguity, you would have to write it something like this:
```markdown
- This is a block formula, placed inline 
    $$
    \text{A Formula}
    $$
```
- As described in the Quartz documentation: https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/Latex

Generally, it is not possible to change the markdown rendering engine. An alternative solution may therefore be to rewrite unusual block formulas to a more usual format that renders same, but may be unambiguously parsed across rendering engines.

This is exactly the goal of this project.

A rewrite should ensure the following:
- **Block Isolation**: Every `$$` delimiter must be placed on their own line.
- **Indentation** of the math block is determined by the line where the **opening** `$$` occurs.
	- **List Item Context:** If the line starts with a bullet (`-`, `*`, `+`) or ordered list marker (`1.`), the math block is indented by **4 spaces** relative to the start of the line.
	- **Standard Context:** If the line is not a list item, the math block preserves the **same indentation** as the start of the line.
- **Continuation Text:** Any text immediately following a closing `$$` on the same line is moved to a new line, using the same indentation calculated for the math block.
- **Whitespace Handling:**
    - Leading/trailing whitespace within the math content is trimmed.
    - Redundant blank lines around the `$$` markers are trimmed.

Here are some example rewrites.

Input 1: Simple bullet with inline math
```markdown
- Bullet $$\text{Some Text}$$

```markdown
- Bullet
    $$
    \text{Some Text}

    - Inner bullet 1 $$\text{Some Text}$$
    - Inner bullet 2
- Outer bullet 2

- Outer bullet 1
    - Inner bullet 1

- Outer bullet 2
```

Input 3: Multiple math blocks in one line
```markdown
- Bullet 1 $$\text{Some Text}$$some more text$$\text{Some more text}$$

    \text{Some Text}
